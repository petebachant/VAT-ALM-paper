# Response to reviewer 4

We thank the reviewer for his or her detailed comments, which we have addressed
to improve the manuscript significantly.

>The use of OpenFOAM should be included in a suitable form in the Abstract, Keywords and Introduction.

We have modified the manuscript accordingly.

>line 24 reads don't shoud read do not

This has been updated in the manuscript.

>A list of abbreviations should be made eg. what does ALE, MHK stand for? line 114, 198

We have removed "ALE" and replaced with "actuator line element" since it was
only used once, and have defined other acronyms at first appearance in the text.
We can add a nomenclature section if it is compatible with the journal style
guidelines.

>line 133 reads know should read known.

Thanks for catching this. It has been corrected.

>line 181: reads no should read not

This has been corrected in the manuscript.

>line 248-249. The experiments are not shown in the Figure

We have omitted reprinting the figure from the experimental study since the
paper is already getting lengthy. Please advise if this figure is necessary.

>Figure 10 SST and SAnot defined.

We have added these definitions to the figure caption.

>Figure 12. The geomtry of the impeller should be shown

Since the blades are not actually resolved in the mesh, we feel that it may
be confusing to include them in the figure, since it may imply they were.
Turbine geometry may also block detail on the downstream side of the rotor.
However, we would be willing to include this geometry if the reviewer thinks
it is truly important for understanding the contours.

>Figure 14. Difficult to see the scale. Should it be rescaled?

We have scaled this the same as the RANS turbulence kinetic energy figure to
show how much lower the values are. This is similar to how the blade-resolved
results were plotted in the referenced study.
