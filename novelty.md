# Novelty of "Actuator line modeling of vertical-axis turbines"

Actuator line modeling (ALM) has only been applied in previous work for a 2-D,
low Reynolds number vertical-axis turbine, using large eddy simulation (LES) and
performance predictions were not reported. In this work, we have developed an
ALM and validated---using both Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes and LES
turbulence models---against sufficiently high Reynolds number 3-D vertical-axis
turbine data, looking at both the performance and near-wake characteristics.
Other novel features of this ALM include a Leishman--Beddoes type dynamic stall
model, added mass and flow curvature corrections, and a lifting-line based end
effects model.
